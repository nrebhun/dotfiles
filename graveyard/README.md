# The Dotfile Graveyard

Tools put to rest.

### Atom

Stellar IDE, *despite* its Electron foundations.

Ruthlessly slaughtered by Microsoft following its acquisition of Github, eliminating competition for its other, vastly inferior editor.
Atom's replacement's meteoric rise in popularity in recent months **stills** baffles me, and I write this even after using it as my
primary editor for the last few months in an attempt to understand the fad.

RIP, Atom.

Gone before your time, but not forgotten.
